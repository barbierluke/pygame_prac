Practice Programs from Making Games with Python &amp; Pygame (http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/), to familiarize myself with the Pygame Intfc


# Pygame Installation
I use Arch Linux and the pygame binary from the Arch official repositories installed but I was not to import it (didn't look into it further once I got it working via pip).

However when after installing pip and pip installing pygame, I was able to import pygame with no errors.
